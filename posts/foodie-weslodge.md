We recently celebrated our special day at an elegantly modern saloon called [Weslodge](http://weslodge.com/). Situated right in the midst of the hustle and bustle of King West, the saloon brings a unique take on the more traditional style dining.

The interior is enjoyably decorated as a traditional western saloon, with trophies and antlers mounted on the wall and a very well stocked selection of alcohol. The staff was well dressed to match the overall theme. (Kelly)

An interesting feature of the restaurant was the glass enclosed kitchen, which allowed the curious and/or impatient to watch your food being prepared.

They definitely aren't kidding around with their drink selection. A loaded bar is always a plus! (Kelly)

On to the food, we started with a trio of small sharesâ€¦

Scotch egg, a quail egg wrapped in chorizo with soft golden centre lying atop of a bed of sweet tomato jam and topped off with baby mint and black truffle shavings. Definitely recommended, it's a delightful two biter which would leave you wanting more. For 5$ you can't go wrong with this deliciousness.

Oysters dressed in pickle juice and horseradish, with a side of tobacco sauce and lemon wedges. Simply Delicious.

Beef tartar & Foie Gras mousse. The tartar is well mixed with pickled mustard seed, cripsy capers, and egg white pearls. A side of sour dough was also provided. The tartar was easy on the taste buds and the only thing wrong with the foie gras mousse was that there weren't enough of it. The sough dough was a bit hard and dried out, I would've preferred a softer dough.

Bison ribeye, with juniper rub and covered with green olive tabouli. The meat was tender and flavourful. I thought the excessive sauce was a bit sloppy, the presentation of the dish requires some work.

Weslodge burger. Wild mushrooms, smoked cheddar and dill aioli, with a side of house fries and house ketchup. Perfect way to make sure you don't leave hungry. The only thing I had a problem with was the bagel/pretzel styled bun, I would rather prefer the traditional grilled white bread bun that everyone love and enjoy at a home bbq. The home fries were fresh, thick cut and softly cooked, very well done.

We wrapped our dinner with a deliciously presented whipped pannacotta. Honey cake with apple, caramelized ganache and walnuts. 


If we didn't have a movie to catch (Dawn of the planet of the Apes, was good!), I would have been tempted to sit for a while and enjoy a post dinner drink (Bourbon/Whiskey sour, made proper with egg white and angostura bitters. Perfect drink to help you digest your recently devoured meal). We thought better of it, and wrapped up our evening dinner and headed to the theatre in the rain.
