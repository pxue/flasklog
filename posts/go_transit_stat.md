I have been taking the GO train, a southern Ontario train service on and off for a good part of last 4 years. Looking back, I've spent a considerable amounts of time sitting on the train every single day.

Let's do some quick calculations, I have done 4 x 4 monthes internships in Toronto where I took the train twice every single day, that would make approximately 85 [working days](http://www.workingdays.ca) * 4 times = 340. For simplicity sake, let's just make it a full year = 365 days.

So for that entire year I've been on the train for 2 hours each day. 365 * 2 / 24 = **30.4 days**.

*I've spent a good month on the train.*

With that much time spent in a place, I'd expect myself to develop some interesting habbits and/or patterns. Aka, Perfect data to be visualized!

Let's graph Weekday vs Hour of day that I usually take the train, this would show my pattern of when I start work each day and which days of the week I tend to stay out, working of course! ;)

Unfortunately, I have only one month of data (d'oh!), nontheless, it should be enough to demonstrate the point.

Pretty interesting results, having flexible working hours, I usually take the train to work at 8am. The more interesting data is when I come home. It's not surprising that I hang out late on Fridays, but what's interesting is that Tuesday is also a party day for me! What a rebel!
