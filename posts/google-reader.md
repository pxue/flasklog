Google Reader has been a part of my life for a very long time. From what it tells me, it has been with me for 4 years, 4 months, and 16 days. Soon, it will leave me for a better place.

Let's take a moment and reminiscent, all the amazing articles I've read, understood, confused over, got emotional about...

Since __February 2, 2009__ I have read a total of __98,832__ items.

Over the past 30 days, I have read:

1. __2,654__ Hacker's News Articles, which represents __80%__ of my total reads.
2. __70__ other articles contributing from JoyStiq, Kotaku, and Steam RSS feed.

I'm a clusted reader, every week or so I pick a day to catch up on all my reads.
Just so it happens it fell on May 28th (second day on the new job, shh), June
5th, and June 11th.

As above dates has hinted, I read the most on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and
barely on Sunday and Monday.

![timeofday](/static/images/time_of_day.png)

I read the most right after lunch, around 2pm. The spike at 8am is usually when
I'm on the train. Non during 2am - 7am (asleep).

I have since transfered my subscriptions over to [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/).
A very stylish alternative to Google Reader and is getting better all the time.
