It's end of April, spring is starting and I've finished my tax filings. This is
usually the time that I go through all my spendings of the previous year and
tally up the battle damages.

I've been using Mint since late 2012, it's a blast to use and let's me quickly
search and collect data on all my accounts. I try to use Visa for all my
purchases, besides the obvious benefits of using a credit card, this way I don't
need a chequing account and can limit my debit transactions to just bills and
transfers.

For the first part, I've pulled out my coffee spending since late 2012 and
aggregated all to two simple graphs below.


By Coffee Shops:

Starbucks is the clear winner, the next two are Timmy's and Williams (both
frequent stops during my last year in school).

By Day of the week:

A more interesting graph is break down of my coffee habit by day of the week. It
looks like I spend about the same amount each day, except Sundays. A localized
peak on Mondays, and a maxima on Wednesdays (midweek hump push) and then coffee
consumption declines through the weekend.

I will likely do this analysis for other type of spending as well, namely
Restaurants/Fast Food and Alcohol purchases.
