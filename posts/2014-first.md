It's 2014! Another year of wonderful opportunities and achievements. Looking back and 2013, it's been a busy and life changing year. In 2013, I graduated from Electrical Engineering undergrad at University of Waterloo, [travelled Europe](http://pxue.ca/posts/europe-tour), met amazing new people, found a calling at a wonderful company called [Chango](http://chango.com), moved in to a cozy condo of my own, and never looked back since!

Best way to start the new year? [Winter Classics](http://www.cbc.ca/sports-content/hockey/nhlwinterclassic/), and a little bit of [muted jazz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkJfL6KQ058).
