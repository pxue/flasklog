My girlfriend and I had the pleasure of dining at [The Fifth Grill & Terrace](http://thefifthgrill.com/) one friday evening in July.

The location of dining was a charming rooftop bar and patio overlooking the intersection of Queen west and Duncan. While situated in the heart of Toronto and surrounded by the bustle of the traffic down below, the patio provided a peaceful dining experience, perfect for couples trying to get away for an evening and get lost in the moment over a bottle of freshly opened wine.

To reach the dining room patio we had to walk through the bar/club on the first level (deserted at the time, too early maybe?) and take a lift up to the rooftop. The lift was manned by a charming chauffeur and decorated by various nifty toys for you to look at.

I started with the house cured rainbow trout, frissée and orange salad. The orange went surprisingly well with the fish and the crunchiness of the salad provided a well balanced texture in contrast with the softness of the fish.

While Kelly started with the apple glazed pork belly confit with sweet apple compote.

Kelly chose the roasted rack of lamb braised in red wine jus with side of wild leek and roasted new potatoes.

For the main I stuck with my seafood and had miso glazed black cod sauced in caramelized, lime beurre blanc with a side of sesame jasmine rice and what I believe is essentially Choy sum. Unfortunately, the rice was undercooked and almost inedible and the choice of choy sum is quite cheap and strange to pair with the fish.

White chocolate apple pie ice cream bar topped with brown sugar crumble and dressed in caramel sauce. It tasted exactly as you would imagine an apple pie with vanilla ice cream would taste like. While not overly sweet, it found a balance between the sourness of the apple and the sweetness of the ice cream. The sauce and topping of brown sugar crumble was a very nice touch. (Kelly)

The Mojito cheese cake with lime cream and shaved coconut was a blend of creamy smoothness that went over very well with the established taste of the mojito. Not too sweet, a hint of mint and the zest of lime brought out the realness of the alcohol, while the dabbles of roasted coconut shavings accentuated it to perfectness. (Kelly)

For the wine, we paired the evening with a bottle of Domaine Gauby Les Calcinaires 2009, which is a bottle of mix blends from the southern France region of Côtes du Roussillon. Highly recommend although quite overpriced.

Overall the evening was very enjoyable, the atmosphere was comfortable and idyllic. Perfect for a couple to get away from the busyness of the city and just enjoy each other's company.
